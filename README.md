# fillergame
A little command-line game for 2 players using GRPC and a local server/client architecture

This project's purpose was to learn and apply the concepts around GRPC in a real-world working example. You can try the game using either `go get https://github.com/pascallohrer/fillergame/cmd/fillergame-client` and `go get https://github.com/pascallohrer/fillergame/cmd/fillergame-server`, which should install both apps to your machine, or clone the repository and build the packages in the cmd/ folder. Run the server first, then the client twice. Usernames and passwords are arbitrary, no authentication functionality was built in this project (although the protobuf API is designed to support it). Apologies if colors are difficult to distiguish, they are rendered very differently by different command line apps. If playing the game is impossible with the colors in your CLI, toggle the comment block in the client's field.go in order to switch to symbols instead of colors and rebuild the client.
